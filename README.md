# Advent of Code 2023 - Day 5

This repository contains my solution for the Advent of Code 2023 challenge, specifically for Day 5.

## Notes

For part 2 (the latest iteration), it seems like it finds 1.9 billion seeds and it might take a while.
I suggest running on a release build:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
